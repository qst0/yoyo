## List

[Yo Yo Buying](http://cerealize.me/yoyo/yoyobuying)

Sleeper - Throw the yoyo and let it spin at the end of the string

Responsive Tug - Tug on the string of the responsive yoyo to make it return

[Robin Hood](http://www.rethinkyoyo.com/home/robin-hood) - Make an 'L' with your throw hand and pull the string through between your thumb and string finger. Release the pulled back string and it will cause a tug brining back a responsive yoyo.

Front Style Bind - Feed the tail back into the direction the yoyo is spinning

Strong Throws - Make sure that the yoyo can spin for a nice long time. Watch out, since when you bind it will come back to your hand as fast as it is spinning, give the yoyo time to slow down after a strong throw
