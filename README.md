[Yo Yo Buying](http://cerealize.me/yoyo/yoyobuying)

Sleeper - Throw the yoyo and let it spin at the end of the string

Front Style Bind - Feed the tail back into the direction the yoyo is spinning

Strong Throws - Make sure that the yoyo can spin for a nice long time. Watch out, since when you bind it will come back to your hand as fast as it is spinning, give the yoyo time to slow down after a strong throw
