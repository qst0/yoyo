# Throw Buying!

Don't think too much into this one.

Yoyo buying can become a hobby itself.

I suggest buying a throw that is in your price range and has decent reviews.

You get what you pay for, so spending some on a throw isn't a bad idea.

Check out all sorts of sites for more info you'll find when it comes to this part of yoyo's the information quality is supurb and the details are there...

But this is a skill itself to develop.

This is a simple step:

Just make sure you have one that's your own!
