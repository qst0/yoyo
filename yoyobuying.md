# Throw Buying!

Don't think too much into this one.

Yoyo buying can become an obbsession itself.

I suggest buying a throw that is in your price range that has at least decent reviews.

You get what you pay for, so spending about $30 on a throw isn't a bad idea.

Personally at the higher range of cost, $80 or higher, the quality is all very high and the details are there...

But this is a skill itself to develop.

A trick to work on.

How many throws have you thrown?

Just make sure you have one that's your own!
